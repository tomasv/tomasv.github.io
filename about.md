My name is Tomas Varneckas.
I do software development and occasionally write about it.

I live and work in Vilnius. Currently I'm with [Vinted](http://engineering.vinted.com).

I specialize in Ruby and Ruby on Rails. Besides Ruby I'm interested in up and coming languages like Clojure and Go. I keep my ear to the ground. :)
